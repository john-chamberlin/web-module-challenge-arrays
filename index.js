/*🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Task 1: Copy the Array! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
We have an array called originalFlavors with 31 flavors (see above).  In these tasks, we will be reading and writing data to this array.  
With all of these changes going on, we don't want to lose track of the actual, original 31 flavors.  So we need to copy the original array!

/*
Use the copy function below to do the following:
    1. Receive one argument: for your  original array
    2. Return the new array that holds an exact copy of the old array  
*/

function copy(arr) {
  return [...arr];
}

/*🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Task 2: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 
Confirm that an array is exactly 31 flavors. Your function should accept:
    1. an array
    2. Check to see if the array given is 31 falvors
    3. Your function should return a boolean TRUE if the length of the array is 31 and FALSE if the length of the array is NOT 31.
  

For Example: is31Flavors(originalFlavors) will return true if your code is working properly
*/

function is31Flavors(arr) {
  if (arr.length === 31) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
console.log(is31Flavors(is31Flavors));

/* 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Task 3: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 
Corporate has come to you with an idea for a new flavor: Rainbow Sherbert! They think this will be a game changer. You need to modify the array to include this flavor. 

Use the addFlavor function below to do the following:
    1. Receive an array
    2. Receive a new flavor as a string
    3. Add the passed flavor to the front of the array
    4. Return the resulting array

    For example: addFlavor("Rainbow Sherbert", originalFlavors) should return the array ["Rainbow Sherbert", "Banana Nut Fudge",..."Vanilla Burnt Almond"]
*/

function addFlavor(arr, newFlavor) {
  arr.unshift(newFlavor);
  return arr;
}

/* 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Task 4: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Houston, we have a problem! There are now 32 flavors in the originalFlavors array! Your task is to remove an item from the end of the array. 

Use the removeLastFlavor function below to do the following:
    1. Receive receive an array
    2. Remove the last item from the array
    3. Return the resulting array

    For example: running removeLastFlavor(originalFlavors) would return ["Rainbow Sherbert", "Banana Nut Fudge",..."Vanilla"]
*/

function removeLastFlavor(arr) {
  arr.pop();
  return arr;
}

/* 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Task 5: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Write a function that returns a flavor at a given index in the array.

Use the getFlavorByIndex function below to do the following:
    1. Recieve an array and an index
    2. Return the flavor located at the received index position

    For example: running getFlavorByIndex(originalFlavors, 2) would return "Black Walnut", assuming Rainbow Sherbert has been added successfully
*/

function getFlavorByIndex(arr, indx) {
  return arr[indx];
}

/*🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Task 6: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
As corporate wants to add more and more flavors to their lineup, they've realized that they need to remove flavors based on flavor name, 
as opposed to just arbitrarily removing the first or last flavor. Your task is to get an index by flavor name, and remove that single flavor from the array.  

Use the removeFlavorByName function below to do the following:
    1. Receive an array and a string (the flavour to be removed)
    2. Remove that flavor from the array
    5. Return the resulting array that now contains one less flavor

    For example: running removeFlavorByName(originalFlavors, "Rocky Road") would return an array with the a length of 30 because Rocky Road would have been removed. 

    HINT: You can use .splice() for this
*/

function removeFlavorByName(arr, string) {

/*🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Task 7: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
July 7th is "World Chocolate Day" and Baskin Robins wants to create promotional materials highlighting all of their chocolate flavors. 
Your task is to write a function that checks every item in the array for a string and returns a new array called filteredArray with only the values 
that contain the received string. This would allow you to be able to filter for "Vanilla", "Sherbet", "Lemon" etc. when different holidays roll around 
by passing in those specific strings.

Use the filterByWord function below to do the following:
    1. Receive an array and a string ("chocolate")
    2. Check to see if any of the flavors in the array contain that string
    4. If they do, add them to a new array
    5. Return the new array that contains the filtered flavors

    For example: filterByWord(originalFlavors, "Chocolate") should return ["Chocolate", "Chocolate Almond", "Chocolate Chip", "Chocolate Fudge", "Chocolate Mint", "Chocolate Ribbon"]

    HINT - you can use the .includes method to help you solve this

    DO NOT USE ADVANCED ARRAY METHODS (i.e. .filter) to solve this problem.

/* STRETCH 1: Write a function that returns the average number of words in an array. You should be able to use this function for any array, but can test with originalFlavors.

Use the getAverageWordLength function below to do the following:
    1. Receive the originalFlavors array
    2. Count how many words per item in the array
    3. Return the average number of words per item in the array

    For example: getAverageWordLength(originalFlavors) should return a number between 0 and 3.     */

/* 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪 STRETCH 2: 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Baskin Robins now offers new flavors, seasonal flavors, and even regional flavors. Write a function that will randomly select a total of 31 flavors 
from originalFlavors, currentFlavors, seasonalFlavors, and regionalFlavors and store it in an array called randomFlavors.

Use the getRandomFlavors function and new arrays below to do the following:
    1. Receive the four arrays with all the differnet flavors (originalFlavors is above, the others are below)
    2. Randomly pick flavors from all four arrays
    3. Return a new array called randomFlavors that has a lenght of 31

    For example: getRandomFlavors(originalFlavors, newFlavors, seasonalFlavors, regionalFlavors) might return ["Strawberry Cheesecake", "Eggnog,"..."Chocolate"].
